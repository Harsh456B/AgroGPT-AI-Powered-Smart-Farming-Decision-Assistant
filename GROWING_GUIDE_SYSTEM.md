## Example: Rice Cultivation Guide

```
🌾 Rice Cultivation Guide
⏱️ Duration: 120-150 days
📍 Location: Kerala
🌤️ Season: Kharif

📋 Phase 1: 🌱 Land Preparation (Week 1-2)
   Steps:
   1. Plow the field 2-3 times to break soil clods
   2. Level the field properly for uniform water distribution
   3. Apply 10-15 tons of farmyard manure per hectare
   4. Create bunds around the field to hold water

📋 Phase 2: 🌱 Seed Preparation & Sowing (Week 2-3)
   Steps:
   1. Soak seeds in water for 24 hours
   2. Treat seeds with fungicide to prevent diseases
   3. Prepare nursery beds with fine soil
   4. Sow seeds at 1-2 cm depth, 5-10 cm apart
   5. Maintain 2-3 cm water level in nursery

📋 Phase 3: 🌱 Transplanting (Week 4-5)
   Steps:
   1. Uproot 25-30 day old seedlings carefully
   2. Transplant at 20x15 cm spacing
   3. Maintain 3-5 cm water level after transplanting
   4. Apply first dose of nitrogen fertilizer

📋 Phase 4: 🌱 Vegetative Growth (Week 6-10)
   Steps:
   1. Maintain 5-7 cm water level
   2. Apply second dose of nitrogen fertilizer
   3. Control weeds by hand weeding or herbicides
   4. Monitor for pest attacks (stem borer, leaf folder)

📋 Phase 5: 🌱 Flowering & Grain Formation (Week 11-14)
   Steps:
   1. Maintain 3-4 cm water level
   2. Apply third dose of nitrogen fertilizer
   3. Control water to prevent lodging
   4. Monitor for diseases like blast and bacterial blight

📋 Phase 6: 🌱 Maturity & Harvesting (Week 15-20)
   Steps:
   1. Stop irrigation 7-10 days before harvest
   2. Harvest when 80-85% grains turn golden yellow
   3. Thresh immediately to prevent grain loss
   4. Dry grains to 12-14% moisture content
```

## Technical Implementation

### **Files Modified:**
1. `cli_assistant/ml_predict.py` - Added `get_crop_growing_guide()` function
2. `cli_assistant/smart_farming_chatbot.py` - Integrated growing guide in CLI output
3. `website/views.py` - Added growing guide to web interface

### **Function Signature:**
```python
def get_crop_growing_guide(crop_name, season, location):
    """
    Provides step-by-step growing process guide for different crops
    
    Args:
        crop_name (str): Name of the crop
        season (str): Growing season (Kharif/Rabi/Zaid)
        location (str): Growing location
        
    Returns:
        dict: Complete growing guide with phases and steps
    """
```

### **Guide Structure:**
```python
{
    'title': '🌾 Rice Cultivation Guide',
    'duration': '120-150 days',
    'steps': [
        {
            'phase': '🌱 Land Preparation (Week 1-2)',
            'steps': [
                'Plow the field 2-3 times to break soil clods',
                'Level the field properly for uniform water distribution',
                # ... more steps

# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Guide for AgroGPT

## ✅ **Project Status: Ready for Deployment**

Your AgroGPT project is now configured with Git LFS and optimized for Vercel deployment.

## 📋 **What's Configured:**

### **Git LFS Setup:**
- ✅ Large files tracked with Git LFS
- ✅ `.gitattributes` configured for model files, datasets, images
- ✅ Deployment excludes large files for faster builds
- ✅ Separate `requirements_deploy.txt` for lightweight deployment

### **Vercel Configuration:**
- ✅ `vercel.json` optimized for Django
- ✅ `build_files.sh` handles deployment process
- ✅ Static files configured with WhiteNoise
- ✅ Database migrations included

## 🚀 **Deploy to Vercel:**

### **Step 1: Connect to Vercel**
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "New Project"

### **Step 2: Import Repository**
1. Select your GitHub repository: `Harsh456B/AgroGPT`
2. Vercel will auto-detect it's a Python project

### **Step 3: Configure Build Settings**
```
Framework Preset: Other
Root Directory: ./
Build Command: bash build_files.sh
Output Directory: staticfiles
Install Command: pip install -r requirements_deploy.txt
```

### **Step 4: Environment Variables (Optional)**
```
DEBUG=False
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
```

### **Step 5: Deploy**
Click "Deploy" and wait for build completion.

## 📁 **File Structure for Deployment:**

```
AgroGPT/
├── agrogpt_web/          # Django settings & URLs
├── website/              # Django app with templates
├── requirements_deploy.txt # Lightweight dependencies
├── build_files.sh        # Build script
├── vercel.json          # Vercel configuration
├── wsgi.py              # Generated for Vercel
└── .gitattributes       # Git LFS configuration
```

## 🔧 **What Gets Deployed:**

### **Included:**
- ✅ Django application
- ✅ Website templates and static files
- ✅ Database migrations
- ✅ Lightweight dependencies

### **Excluded (for faster deployment):**
- ❌ Large model files (*.pkl, *.joblib)
- ❌ Dataset files (*.csv)
- ❌ Visualization images
- ❌ Training scripts
- ❌ Virtual environment

## 🎯 **Benefits of This Setup:**

1. **Fast Deployment:** Lightweight build without large files
2. **Git LFS:** Large files available for development
3. **Scalable:** Easy to add ML features later
4. **Cost-Effective:** Minimal Vercel usage
5. **Maintainable:** Clean separation of concerns

## 🔄 **Adding ML Features Later:**

If you want to add ML features to the deployed version:

1. **Option 1:** Use external ML APIs (recommended)
2. **Option 2:** Deploy models separately on ML platforms
3. **Option 3:** Use Vercel's larger function limits

## 📞 **Support:**

Your project is now ready for deployment! The configuration handles:
- ✅ Large file management with Git LFS
- ✅ Fast Vercel deployment
- ✅ Django optimization
- ✅ Static file serving

**Deploy now and your AgroGPT website will be live!** 🎉
